# DSA Pattern Questions Repository

This repository contains the pattern-printing questions that I solved as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course at Coding Blocks. 
These practice exercises reinforce my understanding of loops, conditional statements, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques.
